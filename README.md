# Rockbuster_SQL
This is a SQL-based project involving a fictious video rental company, Rockbuster Stealth LLC. Feeling pressure from online streaming giants such as Netflix and Amazon I have been tasked with developing a strategy for the new online service. Using historical data I must analyze current movie license trends and answer any ad-hoc business questions that other departments may have using PostgreSQL. This project is part of the CareerFoundry data analytics course.

# Objective
The aim of this analysis is to answer the business questions of the Management Board and provide the Business Intelligence department with data driven insights and recommendations to assist in their decision-making. Analysis of current customers base and their rental patterns are some of the data explored.

# Data
The data is provided by CareerFoundry and is available [here](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dvdrental.zip)
